### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (for demo purposes)

## Data Models

### User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  password?: string; // Optional for demo purposes
  avatar?: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### Task Model
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  category: string;
  dueDate?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  userId: string;
}
```

### State Models
```typescript
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

interface TaskState {
  tasks: Task[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  filter: {
    status: string;
    priority: string;
    category: string;
  };
}
```

## Authentication Logic

### Registration Flow
1. User submits registration form with email, password, and name
2. System validates input data
3. Check if user already exists in localStorage
4. Create new user object with unique ID and timestamp
5. Store user in localStorage users array
6. Set current user in localStorage auth key
7. Update application state with authenticated user

### Login Flow
1. User submits login form with email and password
2. System retrieves users from localStorage
3. Find user by email address
4. Validate password (simple comparison for demo)
5. Set current user in localStorage auth key
6. Update application state with authenticated user

### Session Management
- Current user stored in localStorage under 'taskflow_auth' key
- Session persists across browser sessions
- Logout clears localStorage auth data

## Task Management Logic

### Task Creation
1. User fills out task form with required fields
2. System validates input data
3. Generate unique task ID using timestamp
4. Create task object with user ID association
5. Add timestamps for createdAt and updatedAt
6. Store task in localStorage tasks array
7. Update local state to reflect new task

### Task Updates
1. User modifies task through UI interactions
2. System identifies task by ID
3. Update specific fields while preserving others
4. Update updatedAt timestamp
5. Save changes to localStorage
6. Update local state to reflect changes

### Task Filtering
- Status filter: 'all', 'pending', 'in-progress', 'completed'
- Priority filter: 'all', 'low', 'medium', 'high'
- Category filter: 'all' or specific category names
- Search functionality: filters by title and description

### Task Deletion
1. User confirms deletion action
2. System removes task from localStorage array
3. Update local state to remove deleted task

## Component Structure

### App Component (Main Container)
- Manages global application state
- Handles routing between different views
- Provides authentication context
- Coordinates data flow between components

### Authentication Components
- **AuthForm**: Handles login/register UI and validation
- Manages form state and submission
- Toggles between login and register modes

### Layout Components
- **Header**: Navigation, user info, logout functionality
- **Sidebar**: Navigation between different app sections
- Responsive design with mobile considerations

### Task Components
- **TaskList**: Displays filtered tasks in grid layout
- **TaskCard**: Individual task display with actions
- **TaskModal**: Task creation and editing interface
- Handles task state changes and user interactions

### Dashboard Components
- **Dashboard**: Overview with statistics and recent tasks
- Displays key metrics and progress indicators
- Quick access to task creation

### Analytics Components
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive task analytics and reporting
- Charts for status distribution and priority breakdown
- Productivity trends and category statistics

### Calendar Components
- **Calendar**: Monthly calendar view with task integration
- Task visualization on calendar dates
- Date selection and task filtering

### Settings Components
- **Settings**: User preferences and account management
- Profile editing, notification settings
- Data export/import functionality
- Security settings and account deletion

## State Management

### Custom Hooks

#### useAuth Hook
```typescript
const useAuth = () => {
  const [authState, setAuthState] = useState<AuthState>({
    user: null,
    isLoading: true,
    error: null,
  });

  // Authentication methods
  const login = async (email: string, password: string) => { ... };
  const register = async (email: string, password: string, name: string) => { ... };
  const logout = async () => { ... };

  return { ...authState, login, register, logout };
};
```

#### useTasks Hook
```typescript
const useTasks = (userId: string) => {
  const [taskState, setTaskState] = useState<TaskState>({
    tasks: [],
    isLoading: true,
    error: null,
    filter: { status: 'all', priority: 'all', category: 'all' },
  });

  // Task management methods
  const createTask = async (taskData) => { ... };
  const updateTask = async (taskId, updates) => { ... };
  const deleteTask = async (taskId) => { ... };
  const setFilter = (filter) => { ... };

  return { ...taskState, createTask, updateTask, deleteTask, setFilter };
};
```

## Data Flow

### Application Initialization
1. App component mounts
2. useAuth hook checks localStorage for existing session
3. If user found, set authenticated state
4. useTasks hook loads user's tasks from localStorage
5. Render appropriate UI based on authentication state

### Task Operations Flow
1. User interacts with task UI (create, update, delete)
2. Component calls appropriate hook method
3. Hook updates localStorage data
4. Hook updates local state
5. React re-renders affected components
6. UI reflects changes immediately

### Filter Operations Flow
1. User changes filter criteria
2. Filter state updates in useTasks hook
3. filteredTasks computed property recalculates
4. TaskList component re-renders with filtered results

## Business Rules

### Task Validation
- Title is required and must not be empty
- Priority must be one of: 'low', 'medium', 'high'
- Status must be one of: 'pending', 'in-progress', 'completed'
- Due date must be valid date format if provided
- Category is optional but recommended for organization

### User Validation
- Email must be valid format and unique
- Password must be at least 6 characters (demo requirement)
- Name is required for registration
- Users can only access their own tasks

### Data Integrity
- Each task belongs to exactly one user
- Task IDs are unique across the system
- Timestamps are automatically managed
- Deleted tasks are permanently removed

## API Design

### Authentication Endpoints (Simulated)
```typescript
// authService methods
login(email: string, password: string): Promise<User>
register(email: string, password: string, name: string): Promise<User>
logout(): Promise<void>
getCurrentUser(): Promise<User | null>
```

### Task Endpoints (Simulated)
```typescript
// taskService methods
getTasks(userId: string): Promise<Task[]>
createTask(taskData: Omit<Task, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt' | 'userId'>, userId: string): Promise<Task>
updateTask(taskId: string, updates: Partial<Task>): Promise<Task>
deleteTask(taskId: string): Promise<void>
```

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Demo)
- Simple password storage (not hashed)
- Client-side only validation
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- No encryption of sensitive data

### Production Recommendations
- Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Server-side validation and sanitization
- HTTPS for all communications
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation and XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Secure session management

## Performance Optimizations

### Current Optimizations
- React.memo for component memoization where appropriate
- Efficient filtering using JavaScript array methods
- Minimal re-renders through proper state management
- Lazy loading of components where beneficial

### Future Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for large task lists
- Debounced search functionality
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Code splitting for route-based chunks
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Error Handling

### Current Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in async operations
- Error state management in hooks
- User-friendly error messages
- Form validation feedback

### Error Recovery
- Graceful degradation when localStorage is unavailable
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Fallback UI states for error conditions

## Testing Strategy

### Recommended Testing Approach
- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for user workflows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing for large datasets

### Key Test Cases
- User authentication flows
- Task CRUD operations
- Filter and search functionality
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Error handling scenarios
- Responsive design validation

## Deployment Considerations

### Build Process
- Vite build optimization
- Asset minification and compression
- Environment variable management
- Static file serving configuration

### Hosting Requirements
- Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- HTTPS certificate
- Custom domain configuration
- CDN for asset delivery
- Monitoring and analytics setup
